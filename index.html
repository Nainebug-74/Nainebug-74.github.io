            <p> I began my journey into IT support in January 2021 by taking my first computer classes during Covid. I started at Howard College in Big Spring, Texas. Until then I had never taken a computer copurse or even a typing class.
                The abrupt decision to start a career in a field I had little knowledge of was a drastic change at a time when the worl as we all knew it was suddenly unrecognizable day to day. 
                
            <p> I am currently working in a helpdesk role in the corporate office of an oil company. 
                Professionally, I would like to develop enough in the company to allow me to build myself a career that will provide me with the income I will need to get my homestead prepared and operational for retirement. 
                To date I have not decided on a specialization, as I enjoy a little of everything computer related and am not particularly passionate about any one part. My goal is to learn about everything that is needed to eventually allow me to work in computer repair and support as a small business locally in Big Spring. 
                This would not be full time, but instead would be a supplement to my homestead during retirement. </p>

            <p> I have developed a proficiency for the hardware repair portion of my career as well as a proficiency for troubleshooting Windows and most software. I am still eager to gain more knowledge about the development and utilization of aspects, such as, web design and multiple applications for computer use. 
                I believe eventually I will need to also study aspects of business and bookkeeping. I find myself not as excited about those aspects of my goals. 
                I will admit that my goals are not fully defined yet, but I am committed to continuous learning and growth in the field of computer technology. </p>
