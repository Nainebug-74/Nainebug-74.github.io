## **Project Plan**
I am building a functional website using HTML and a CSS file for my CMPA class. The purpose is to show a minimal up to excellent competency learned this school term from the classwork assigned. This requires a working two page website. Both of the pages using one Style.css and containing working links to each other.

## **Work Schedule**
* Study GitHub help to learn how to link pages - several days
* Make adjustments to the existing index.HTML to add more depth and effort into the project - 2 days max
* Make adjustments to the Style.css to add a little more flair and make the appearance more appealing - one day and if everything else is completed then make additional adjustments
* Build proper files for the documents folder - 2-3 days
* Final day review files and website pages and perform revision to .Css after ensuring all spelling and formatting is correct

## **Risk**
* Breaking the current functional files that I struggled to get formatted correctly
* Not completing on time due to attempting to restyle what was working correctly
* Not meeting all of the requirements for the rubric by overlooking one of the required files or formats
* Failing to submit by midnight on March 1

## **Tame control**
* Transfer - build files in visiual studio code and then add to GitHub after they are satisfactory
* Accept - investing extra time to ensure development is completed to satisfaction
* Mitigate - use https://share.google/A2p48unCWV5XAUG9L to ensure that my HTML files are working correctly before adding them to GitHub repository
* Eliminate - use a checklist of what is required to ensure everything is included before submission
