# Retrospective: looking back at my project
**Author:** Barbara Montemayor

## **A look back at this whole process from start to finish**


## **What went well**
* Using an external tool to check my HTML code helped me get the grasp of coding correctly.
* Having a set time dedicated to working on this project each day helped me get work done more efficiently and relieved the stress about completing everything on time.
* Persistence in redoing my work repeatedly and allowing a failed attempt stay broken was key to havi9ng a completed proper final project.
  

## **What went wrong**
* My first few asignments were sloppy and unsuccessful because I could not grasp the coding.
* Delaying work because I was not good at it resulted in sub-par submissions that were rushed and sloppy.
* I did not stick to my work plan doing items in the order I set out to do them. Inst4ead I worked on what I felt was important each day.
  

## **What can be changed next time to do better**
* I need to set more time aside daily and be persistent about doing the work daily.
* I will continue to use tools, internal and external, to help me better my understanding of coding on future projects.
* If I am struggling to understand something I need to be willing to reach out and seekassistance from myh instructors and others who are proficient in the subject.
