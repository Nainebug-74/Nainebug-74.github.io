# Project Scope: Final Project CMPA
**Author:** Barbara Montemayor

## Project Purpose
I am building a functional website using HTML and a CSS file for my CMPA class. The purpose is to show a minimal up to excellent competency learned this school term from the classwork assigned.
Completing this assignment correctly will be a great improvement after the struggling I have done with the learning of the HTML code format. I want to get the formatting correct. 
This means adhearing to the simplicity of basics and not trying to make drastic changes to the formatting that may result in questionable formatting.

## Desired Outcomes
* **Outcome 1:** A publicly accessible website with proper functionality and style
* **Outcome 2:** A GitHub repository that shows professional documentation of creation and commits for changes made
* **Outcome 3:** A linked CSS file for consistent styling of my website

## Project Exclusions
* No complex coding languages attempted
* No attempt to insert complex functions for payments or selections of choice

## Technical Requirements
* Semantic HTML5 structure.
* External CSS stylesheet.
* Publicly accessible URL via GitHub Pages.
